# Trashcan Reminder
Homey will remind you to put the trash out! You can do this by providing a postcode, house number and country(NL/BE).

## Supported Cities
Unfortunately not all cities work with the Trashcan Reminder, if you can find your house with one of the links below your house is supported:

- [mijnAfvalWijzer](http://www.mijnafvalwijzer.nl)
- [deAfvalApp](http://www.deafvalapp.nl/calendar/kalender_start.jsp)

If your city is not supported you can always add your schedule manually.
If you wish to contribute to the project (for example by adding support for a city) I would advise you to take a look at [this explanation](https://github.com/apstemmer/com.athom.trashchecker/blob/master/developers)

## Supported Cards
There is one card that you can place in the "then" column. The card let's you check if trash type X is collected << today, tomorrow, day after tomorrow >>.

## Supported Speech
You can ask Homey four type of questions regarding your waste collection:
- When is the green container collected?
- What is collected next monday?
- Is the residual waste collected this friday?
- Which type of trash is collected next?
